# About This Fork (`saas-home/Qwen3.8-27B-NV-16GB`)

> [!NOTE]
> This repository is a specialized, production-hardened fork of [`MiaAI-Lab/Qwen3.8-27B-16gb-NVIDIA-GPUs-one-click-install`](https://github.com/MiaAI-Lab/Qwen3.8-27B-16gb-NVIDIA-GPUs-one-click-install), originally created and maintained by [Mia's AI Lab](https://x.com/MiaAI_lab). All original one-click installation workflows, Windows/Linux launchers, and UI harness integrations are the work of Mia's AI Lab.
>
> While upstream provides general 16–32 GB desktop setups, this fork focuses on **maximizing context horizon, multi-turn reasoning stability, and throughput on consumer 16 GB NVIDIA GPUs** (e.g., RTX 4070 Ti SUPER) and extreme long-context developer workloads.
>
> **Key Enhancements in this Fork:**
> - **204,800 Token Context Window:** Expands verified stable context to a full 204.8k tokens (~800 pages) on a single 16 GB card with 3.0 bpw EXL3 and 4-bit Hadamard KV cache.
> - **2-Slot Parallel Continuous Batching (`PARALLEL=2`):** Continuous multi-slot batching engine (`BatchWorker`) supports 2 parallel generation requests simultaneously on GPU with thread-safe per-job queues and graceful FIFO queueing for additional requests.
> - **Dynamic Context Headroom Clamping:** Dynamically computes available KV cache pages per request (`min(max_tokens, max_total - prompt_toks - 2 - num_draft)`), eliminating ExLlamaV3 page allocation crashes on long conversational turns.
> - **Zero-VRAM Multimodal Vision (`EXL3_VISION_PINNED=1`):** Pins the vision tower in host DDR5 RAM, reclaiming ~0.87 GB VRAM directly for the KV cache.
> - **Headless VRAM Budget Optimization:** Automatically detects headless environments (`is_headless()`), increasing usable VRAM to **15.7 GB** (vs. 14.7 GB upstream desktop default).
> - **24 GB DDR5 Host Prompt Cache (`CPU_CACHE_GB=24`):** Secondary host RAM tiering preserves prompt prefixes, yielding **sub-second TTFT (0.93s at 200k tokens)** on iterative reasoning turns.
> - **AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D CPU Affinity:** Pins worker execution to CCD0 3D V-Cache (`AFFINITY=0-7,16-23`), eliminating cross-CCD latency penalties.
> - **Extended Generation Ceiling & Reasoning Hygiene:** Eliminates Coding Agent socket dropouts (`MAX_TOKENS=16384`) and sanitizes historical `<think>` tags (`NO_REASONING_PRESERVE=1`).
> - **Dynamic Engine Resolution:** Supports ExLlamaV3 v1.5.0+ through dynamic semver resolution.
> - **Detailed Technical Whitepaper & Benchmarks:** Comprehensive empirical evaluation, latency curves, and head-to-head comparison against llama.cpp are documented in [Qwen3.8-27B-NV-16GB-Optimization-Whitepaper.md](Qwen3.8-27B-NV-16GB-Optimization-Whitepaper.md).

A serving kit for [Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B) in
**[turboderp](https://huggingface.co/turboderp)**'s EXL3 quants, on one consumer
NVIDIA card. It picks a quant that fits the card it finds, installs its own Python
environment, downloads the weights, serves an **OpenAI-compatible** endpoint, and
opens a chat UI. Windows and Linux, same behaviour.

It started as a 16 GB recipe — the 2.0 bpw quant is still that floor, and still the
one thing here that is not turboderp's own upload ([Mia-AiLab/Qwen3.8-27B-EXL3-2.0bpw](https://huggingface.co/Mia-AiLab/Qwen3.8-27B-EXL3-2.0bpw),
`SC_2.00bpw_H3_V3`). Everything from 2.5 bpw up is pulled from
[turboderp/Qwen3.8-27B-exl3](https://huggingface.co/turboderp/Qwen3.8-27B-exl3)
by revision. Which one you get is [decided by your VRAM](#what-the-launcher-picks-for-your-gpu),
at setup, and you can change it any time.

---

## Before you start (both systems)

| | |
| --- | --- |
| GPU | NVIDIA, 12 GB VRAM or more, compute capability 7.5+ (Turing and newer). 16 GB is the size this kit was built around. |
| Driver | 570 or newer (the default PyTorch build is cu128). |
| Python | **3.11 or newer, 64-bit.** The only thing you install by hand. |
| Node | **22.19+** from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) (current dsh). Older LTS (20) warns `EBADENGINE` and the chat UI may fail. Without Node, `/v1` still serves; the launcher says what is missing. |
| Disk | 9.7–22.9 GB per quant (see the table below), plus several GB for the Python environment and PyTorch. |

**Not needed:** CUDA Toolkit, Visual Studio Build Tools, Git. The engine arrives as a
[prebuilt wheel](#prebuilt-wheels-no-compiler-needed); compiling is the fallback for
platforms no wheel covers.

Everything the kit installs stays inside its own folder — `.venv/`, `models/`,
`logs/`, `apps/`, `.dsh/`. Nothing goes into the system Python and nothing needs
administrator rights.

---

## Windows

Everything is in the `windows\` folder. Run the `.bat` files from Explorer
(double-click) or from a `cmd` window opened in the kit folder.

### 1. Install — `windows\START-HERE.bat`

Double-click it once. It opens a page in your browser and does the whole install
there: it shows what it found on the card, offers the model sizes that fit it, then
installs and downloads with a progress bar and a live log. Nothing is asked in the
console.

When the download finishes it **loads that model** and hands the page over to the
chat, so one double-click takes you from nothing to a working chat window.

```
windows\START-HERE.bat              install, then start what was installed
windows\START-HERE.bat --no-start   install only — for fetching a second size
```

Notes:

* The download is **resumable**. Closing the window, losing the connection or
  rebooting costs you nothing — it picks up from the byte it stopped at. A model
  left half-downloaded is shown as such in the menus, and running
  `windows\START-HERE.bat` again finishes it. Nothing offers to *start* a model
  until every weight file is on disk.
* Prefer the old console questions to the web page? Set `SETUP=console` in `.env`.

### 2. Every day after that — `windows\start.bat`

```
windows\start.bat          start a model that is already here
windows\start.bat setup    go to setup instead (same as START-HERE.bat)
```

It never downloads anything. What it does:

1. **Asks which model**, if more than one size is on disk. Enter takes the one that
   ran last, and it starts on its own after 45 seconds so an unattended machine
   still comes up.
2. **Checks free VRAM** right before the load — it wants the `GPU_MEM_GB` budget
   from `.env` plus a little margin. If that much is not free it lists the programs
   holding VRAM (browsers, games, Discord, other AI tools) and waits: Enter
   re-checks, `c` continues anyway, `q` quits, and it continues on its own after
   120 seconds. **Take this seriously on Windows** — with too little free VRAM the
   driver pages the model into system RAM instead of failing, and it then runs many
   times slower.
3. **Loads the model** and opens the [chat UI](#the-deepseek-harness) at
   `http://127.0.0.1:3080/`.

If nothing is installed yet, or nothing finished downloading, it says so and offers
to run setup for you — double-clicking the wrong one is never a dead end.

Two files rather than one because they answer two different questions:
`windows\start.bat` never downloads, and `windows\START-HERE.bat --no-start` never
loads.

### 3. While it runs

* The console window it opened **is** the server. Closing it stops the model.
* Simplex puts an icon in the notification area — right-click for **Open Simplex**,
  **Restart the model**, **Show the Simplex folder**, **View the log** and
  **Quit Simplex**.
  (`TRAY=no` in `.env` turns it off.)
* Every launch writes a full transcript to `logs\`, so a crash that scrolls past is
  still readable afterwards.
* The first successful launch adds Start-menu and desktop shortcuts
  (`SHORTCUTS=no` in `.env` to skip that).

### 4. Stopping — `windows\stop.bat`

```
windows\stop.bat                 stop both the model and the chat UI
windows\stop.bat --harness-only  leave the model loaded, close the UI
windows\stop.bat --server-only   leave the UI running, unload the model
```

### 5. Windows troubleshooting

| symptom | what to do |
| --- | --- |
| "Simplex needs Python and cannot find it" | Install 64-bit Python 3.11+ from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and tick **Add python.exe to PATH**, then run the file again. |
| Anything else | `windows\simplex.bat doctor` — see [below](#simplex-doctor). |
| The model loads but crawls | Free VRAM (the check above told you what is holding it), or lower `CONTEXT_SIZE` / `GPU_MEM_GB` in `.env`. |
| "Images: off" in the Ready box | The vision tower did not fit next to your context. Lower `CONTEXT_SIZE` and restart, or pick a smaller quant. |
| The window closed and you missed the error | It is in `logs\` — newest file. `windows\simplex.bat logs` prints the tail. |
| You want to start completely over | `reset_new_user.bat` in the kit root deletes the weights, the venv, `.env`, the logs and the shortcuts, and keeps every tracked file. It asks you to type `RESET` first. |

---

## Linux

Everything is in the `linux/` folder. Run the scripts from the **kit root**; they
find their own way regardless of where you call them from.

If the files arrived without their execute bit (a zip, a copy off Windows), run them
as `bash linux/setup.sh` instead of `./linux/setup.sh`, or `chmod +x linux/*.sh linux/simplex` once.

### 1. Install — `./linux/setup.sh`

```bash
./linux/setup.sh
```

It creates `.env` from `.env.example` on the first run, asks the profile questions
**in the terminal** (`tools/profiles.py`) — there is no setup page on Linux — builds
`.venv`, installs PyTorch and the engine, downloads the weights, and stops. It does
not load a model.

The download is resumable: interrupt it and run `./linux/setup.sh` again to carry on.

### 2. Every day after that — `./linux/start.sh`

```bash
./linux/start.sh                 pick a downloaded model and serve it
./linux/start.sh --no-harness    serve /v1 only, no chat UI
./linux/start.sh -b              run in the background, output in logs/
./linux/start.sh --status        is a backgrounded one running?
```

It lists the models that finished downloading and asks which one (Enter is the one
used last; it auto-picks after 45 seconds), then serves:

```
http://localhost:8888/v1     the OpenAI-compatible API
http://127.0.0.1:3080/       the chat UI
```

`-b` is the honest equivalent of the Windows tray: it detaches, writes to
`logs/simplex-*.log`, and tells you where that log is and how to stop it. First-run
setup and the model menu still happen — written to the log instead of the screen.

**On a box with no desktop session** `webbrowser` has nothing to open, so the chat
address is printed for you to copy. Take the whole thing, **token and all** — see
[the note on the token](#the-first-address-is-not-the-plain-one).

There is **no free-VRAM preflight on Linux** (that check is Windows-specific,
because Windows silently spills to system RAM instead of failing). If a load fails
with `Insufficient VRAM in split for model and cache`, lower `CONTEXT_SIZE` or
`GPU_MEM_GB` in `.env`, or close what is holding the card.

No tray icon and no desktop shortcuts either — those are Windows.

### 3. Stopping — `./linux/stop.sh`

```bash
./linux/stop.sh                 stop both
./linux/stop.sh --harness-only  leave the model loaded
./linux/stop.sh --server-only   leave the chat UI running
```

### 4. Linux troubleshooting

| symptom | what to do |
| --- | --- |
| `bash: ./linux/start.sh: Permission denied` | `chmod +x linux/*.sh linux/simplex`, or call it as `bash linux/start.sh`. |
| `$'\r': command not found` | The checkout has CRLF endings. `.gitattributes` prevents this; re-clone, or `sed -i 's/\r$//' linux/*.sh linux/simplex`. |
| Anything else | `./linux/simplex doctor` — see [below](#simplex-doctor). |
| `Insufficient VRAM in split for model and cache` | Lower `CONTEXT_SIZE` or `GPU_MEM_GB` in `.env`, or run `./linux/simplex setup` and pick a smaller quant. |
| It compiled the engine for 20 minutes | No prebuilt wheel matched your CUDA line, torch version or Python. See [Prebuilt wheels](#prebuilt-wheels-no-compiler-needed). |
| aarch64 / GB10 | No prebuilt engine wheel exists on any CUDA line, so it compiles. The script keeps cu130 there and sets `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST=12.0;12.1` for you. |

---

## One command, both systems

The files above are the double-click doors. Every verb, on either system, is
`simplex` — the same program (`tools/cli.py`), so the two cannot drift apart:

| Linux | Windows |
| --- | --- |
| `./linux/simplex <verb>` | `windows\simplex.bat <verb>` |

```
simplex setup                   install the environment and fetch a model
simplex start                   load a model and serve it
simplex start --no-harness      ...serving /v1 only
simplex start -b                ...in the background, log in logs/
simplex start -p 9000           ...on another port, just this once
simplex stop                    stop both
simplex stop --harness-only     ...and detach the UI, model still loaded
simplex restart                 stop, then start
simplex status                  what is running, which model, which ports
simplex status --json           the same, for scripts
simplex logs -f                 follow the launcher log
simplex models                  what is on disk, and what is half-downloaded
simplex harness start           attach the UI to a server already running
simplex harness stop|status|open|settings
simplex doctor                  check this machine before blaming the model
```

`simplex` with no verb prints the help and then the status. Every verb takes
`--help`. It is not on your `PATH` — run it from the kit folder.

### simplex doctor

The first thing to run when something is wrong. It checks the Python version, the
venv and the engine version inside it, the driver and the card, Node, both ports and
who holds them, the `.env` values that have to be valid, whether the weights are all
there, and the free disk.

### With or without the chat UI

`UI=` in `.env` is the standing answer (`browser`, `server` or `no`);
`--harness` / `--no-harness` overrides it for one run, on `simplex start`,
`linux/start.sh` and `windows\start.bat` alike. The UI is also a verb of its own, so
it can be attached to a model that is already loaded, or taken away without
unloading one.

---

## What the launcher picks for your GPU

Setup (`windows\START-HERE.bat` / `./linux/setup.sh`, or `simplex setup`, or
`PROFILE=ask` in `.env`) runs `tools/profiles.py`. It reads the card's VRAM with
`nvidia-smi`, computes what fits under a budget of *VRAM − max(1.3 GB, 8 %)*, and
offers the sizes that fit. Enter takes the recommendation. If a model is already
downloaded, "keep current" is the default, so an unattended start never triggers a
surprise download.

The choice is written into `.env` (`MODEL_DIR`, `HF_TARGET_REPO`, `HF_REVISION`,
`MODEL_ID`, `CONTEXT_SIZE`, `CACHE_QUANT`, `GPU_MEM_GB`, `VISION`) and everything
downstream follows it.

| VRAM | what it offers (**bold** = pre-selected) |
| --- | --- |
| 12 GB | **2.0 bpw @ 33k**, text-only — the floor, and the whole menu |
| 16 GB | 3.5 bpw @ 78k text-only · 3.0 bpw @ 118k with images · **2.5 bpw @ 176k with images** · 2.0 bpw @ 229k with images |
| 24 GB | 6.0 bpw @ 84k text-only · 5.0 bpw @ 180k with images · **4.0 bpw @ 262k with images** · 3.5 and below at 262k with images |
| 32 GB+ | the same menu as 24 GB — the top two rows are capped at what a prefill has actually survived, not at what the card could hold |

KV cache supports both symmetric and asymmetric bit-plane quantization:
- **`CACHE_QUANT=4,3` (4-bit Keys / 3-bit Values)**: **Recommended for 16 GB cards running 204.8k context on ExLlamaV3 v1.5.0**. Quantizes Keys to 4-bit (preserving high-dimensional attentional steering) and Values to 3-bit (8 reconstruction levels). Saves **600 MiB of VRAM** at 200k context (15,284 MiB peak vs. 15,884 MiB baseline), recovering **1,092 MiB (>1 GB) of critical safety headroom** on 16 GB GPUs. Rigorously verified at **100% accuracy** across 16-hop confusable pointer chasing, 8-hop chained dependencies, 60k multi-needle retrieval, algorithmic code execution (25 unit tests), and combinatorial math.
- **`CACHE_QUANT=4` (symmetric int4)**: Measured within 0.001 KL of fp16; baseline recipe. On 16 GB cards at 200k context, leaves only ~65 MiB free headroom.
- **`CACHE_QUANT=4,2` (4-bit Keys / 2-bit Values)**: Aggressive saving recipe recovering **1,348 MiB headroom** and boosting decode speed by +6.2% (30.42 tok/s); suitable for high concurrency, but 2-bit Values can exhibit drift in deep (≥8-hop) sequential variable chains.
- **`CACHE_QUANT=8,4`**: Supported legacy baseline. Picked profiles in `.env` override this.

Each row's download size and the exact context it plans are printed by the planner
itself, and it will do that for any card without you owning one:

```
Windows:  .venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\profiles.py --list --vram 16
Linux:    .venv/bin/python tools/profiles.py --list --vram 16
```

### Where those numbers come from

Where a real prefill has been run at a stated budget, the menu offers what was
measured rather than what the formula computes. The context was grown on a 14.7 GB
budget until a prefill failed (2026-09-06), and the formula had been leaving a lot
on the table:

| budget | quant | planner offered | measured, text | measured, images |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 14.7 GB | 3.5 | 0 | 77824 | 41984 |
| 14.7 GB | 3.0 | 69888 | 148480 | 117760 |
| 14.7 GB | 2.5 | 186368 | 212224 | 176128 |
| 22.1 GB | 6.0 | 8960 | 83712 | 57088 |
| 22.1 GB | 5.0 | 163072 | 204800 | 179712 |
| 22.1 GB | 4.0 | 262144 | 262144 | 262144 |

The formula's flat 2.6 GB overhead is a bound over every quant, so on any one of
them it is slack — 3.5 bpw is the extreme case, priced out of a 16 GB card entirely
by a formula that the card then ran at 78k tokens, and 6.0 bpw is not far behind at
9k against 84k. Above the budget a row was measured under, the formula takes over
again; below it, the measurement only ever lowers the answer.

Two rows are also *capped* at their measurement: nothing has ever prefilled past
204800 tokens on 5.0 bpw or 83712 on 6.0 bpw, at any budget, so neither plans past
it. (Their older ceilings — 183296 for 5.0, "nothing survived" for 6.0 — came from a
run with ~40 other processes on the card, and a clean run at a *tighter* budget beat
both, which is how you tell contention from a ceiling.)

### How the default is chosen

Bold above is the best quality that still has real context (≥ 128k), not the longest
context. On a 16 GB card that is the 2.5 bpw row — 3.0 bpw is the better model, but
it fits 118k there and only text-only, against a measured 176k with images one rung
down. The pick also keeps images where it can: on a 24 GB card 5.0 bpw clears 128k
only by dropping the vision tower, so the default steps one rung down to 4.0 bpw,
which holds native context with images. One rung, never more — and answering
"no images" puts 5.0 bpw back.

Quants other than the 2.0 bpw baseline are pulled from turboderp's branches
(`HF_REVISION`); their vision towers are unquantised (0.87 GB measured), which is
why images are off on the tight profiles. The quality words come from turboderp's
mean-KL-vs-bf16 figures: 2.0 → 0.35 *fair*, 2.5 → 0.30 *good*, 3.0 → 0.11 *better*,
3.5 → 0.08 *very good*, 4.0 → 0.05 *very good*, 5.0 → 0.014 *excellent*,
6.0 → 0.007 *near-lossless*.

### The original 16 GB baseline

A 16 GB board typically has about **14.7 GB free** after the driver. These are the
hand-tuned settings the 2.0 bpw quant was validated on, and what `.env.example`
still ships:

| Knob | Value | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GPU_MEM_GB` | `14.7` | Process cap matching ~14.7 GB free on a 16 GB card |
| `CONTEXT_SIZE` | `199936` | ~200k tokens (must be a multiple of the 256-token page size) |
| `CACHE_QUANT` | `8,4` | int8 K / int4 V |
| `DRAFT` | `mtp` (default) | MTP head inside the checkpoint; ~50 MB extra weights |

Measured at load under that cap: CUDA **allocated 12.35 GiB**, **reserved 13.37
GiB**; native `CONTEXT_SIZE=262144` **fails to boot**
(`Insufficient VRAM in split for model and cache`). Weights on disk are ~9.7 GB; the
rest is KV (16 full-attention layers), the MTP draft cache, GDN recurrent state and
CUDA workspace.

**If you have more than 16 GB:** let the profile planner do it — it already knows.
By hand, a 24 GB card takes `CONTEXT_SIZE=262144` and `GPU_MEM_GB=22`. Do not do
that on 16 GB.

## Chat with the model

### The DeepSeek Harness

The kit serves the model. What you talk to is
**[DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness)** (`dsh`, MIT),
started as a second process once the model is loaded and answering, at
**`http://127.0.0.1:3080/`**. `windows\start.bat` and `./linux/start.sh` open it for
you; `http://127.0.0.1:8888/` is a small page saying where everything is, which
forwards there as soon as the harness answers.

None of it is vendored here. It is a Node application, so the launcher runs it with
`npx` and npm caches it after the first run — which is why **Node** is on the
requirements list. No Node, no harness: the launcher says so, and `/v1` keeps
serving every other client. `UI=no` in `.env` skips it entirely.

**It configures itself against whatever loaded.** Before starting the harness,
`tools/dsh.py` asks the running server on `/v1/models` what it actually is — the
model id, the context window, whether the vision tower fit, and which reasoning
levels this chat template accepts *and acts on* — and writes that as a provider
route into `.dsh/settings.yaml`, naming it as the default the picker opens on. So
the model, its context meter, its image support and its effort menu are right on the
first launch with nothing typed into a form. After a fallback (no room for the
vision tower, say) the harness is told what happened rather than what `.env` hoped
for. Switching quants rewrites the same file; the harness re-reads it per request,
so it never needs restarting.

Those keys are yours the moment you edit them. The launcher keeps a copy of what it
last wrote beside the file and stops generating as soon as they differ, so a
hand-tuned route survives every restart. Delete the file to get a fresh one.
Everything else in it is read past and written back untouched. Every field it
accepts is in
[dsh's configuration catalog](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness/blob/master/docs/config-catalog.md).

#### The first address is not the plain one

dsh authenticates the browser with a token it mints fresh on every launch and prints
once, as `dsh web: http://127.0.0.1:3080/?token=...`. Opening **that** sets a cookie
good for thirty days and redirects to a clean `/`; arriving at the bare address
without it answers *"dsh web authentication required; reopen the URL printed by dsh
web"*. So the launcher reads the address off dsh's own output rather than composing
it from the port, and `http://127.0.0.1:8888/` forwards through `/harness`, which
knows the current one. If you need it by hand, it is in the launcher window and in
`logs/`.

That route only answers a browser on this computer, even with `HOST=0.0.0.0`: the
token is a session on an agent that runs commands here.

| Harness | `http://127.0.0.1:3080/` (`SIMPLEX_HARNESS_PORT` in `.env`; do not use `DSH_PORT` there) |

| Run it alone | From the **kit root** (not `C:\Windows\System32`): `python tools/dsh.py --open`. PowerShell: `Set-Location -LiteralPath <kit>`; cmd: `cd /d <kit>`. `cd /d` is not valid in PowerShell. |
| Just the settings | `tools/dsh.py --settings-only` |

The harness binds loopback only and **refuses to bind `0.0.0.0` at all**: its agent
runs commands on this PC and there is no login. To reach it from a phone, put a
proxy in front of it rather than opening the port — `tailscale serve --bg 3080`.
Note that the shipped `HOST=0.0.0.0` already exposes `/v1` (the API, not the
harness) to whatever network you are on; set `HOST=127.0.0.1` if that network is not
yours.

Its workspace, approval policy, tools, MCP servers and plugins are all its own — see
[its documentation](https://deepseek-harness.github.io/deepseek-harness/). Pick a
workspace folder in it before the first message.

### Any other OpenAI client

`/v1` is a plain OpenAI endpoint, so nothing about the harness is compulsory. Leave
`windows\start.bat` / `./linux/start.sh` running and point a client at it. There is
**no API key**; many apps still require a dummy value such as `local`.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Base URL | `http://127.0.0.1:8888/v1` (or host `http://127.0.0.1:8888` if the app appends `/v1` itself) |
| API key | `local` (ignored) |
| Model id | whatever `MODEL_ID` in `.env` says — e.g. `qwen3.8-27b-exl3-2.5bpw` for the 2.5 bpw quant. `simplex status` prints it, and so does `GET /v1/models`. |

Chatbox, Open WebUI, Continue, Cursor's custom endpoint, Cherry Studio (below), a
`curl`, an SDK, another machine on your network — all of them work against that base
URL, at the same time as the harness does. Open WebUI is stronger if you want a big
tools/RAG UI and are fine running Docker.

**Tool calling.** Send OpenAI `tools` (function name + JSON schema) on
`POST /v1/chat/completions`. The model emits Qwen XML; the server parses it into
`tool_calls`. Your app must run the function and POST a follow-up with
`role: "tool"` (and the previous assistant `tool_calls`). `tool_choice` of `auto`,
`required`, or a named function is supported.

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8888/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "qwen3.8-27b-exl3-2.5bpw",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the weather in Tel Aviv?"}],
    "tools": [{
      "type": "function",
      "function": {
        "name": "get_weather",
        "description": "Current weather for a city",
        "parameters": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {"city": {"type": "string"}},
          "required": ["city"]
        }
      }
    }]
  }'
```

Plain chat (no tools):

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8888/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"qwen3.8-27b-exl3-2.5bpw","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hi"}]}'
```

**Images.** The quants keep Qwen3.8's vision tower and the server loads it by
default (`VISION=auto`), so you can send OpenAI `image_url` content parts — `data:`
URLs or http(s) links. Pictures are downscaled to `IMAGE_MAX_PIXELS`
(1 MP ≈ 1024 prompt tokens) before encoding. If the tower does not fit next to your
context under the VRAM cap, the Ready box says `Images: off` and the server keeps
running text-only — lower `CONTEXT_SIZE` and restart, or pick a quant whose profile
says images are on. Video is not supported.

Defaults: temperature 0.6, top-p 0.95, top-k 20, thinking on. One request at a time;
extras queue.

### Cherry Studio (optional, off by default)

The kit used to ship [Cherry Studio](https://github.com/CherryHQ/cherry-studio) as
its chat app. It is still wired up for anyone who wants Cherry's assistants,
knowledge bases and MCP servers — set `CHERRY_AUTOSTART=ask` (or `yes`) in `.env`:

* The launcher downloads the pinned **portable** build (v2.0.10, ~285 MB, once) into
  `apps/cherry-studio/`. Nothing is installed system-wide; Cherry keeps its data in
  `apps/cherry-studio/data/`.
* The first time, Cherry opens and closes once by itself to create that data folder.
  The kit then writes its configuration straight into Cherry's store: provider
  **Simplex (local)** → `http://127.0.0.1:8888/v1`, key `local`, the model id from
  `.env` (tool calling + image input on), set as the default chat model and on the
  default assistant, onboarding skipped. Usage analytics is switched off
  (Cherry → Settings → Privacy to change).
* After the **Ready** box: *"Open Cherry Studio and start chatting now? [Y/n]"*.
  Enter/`y` opens it (the portable build unpacks for ~10–20 s), `n` or no answer
  within 90 s leaves it closed. Keep the server window open while chatting.
* Changing `PORT` in `.env` re-points the provider on the next start. Open Cherry
  later without the prompt: `.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\cherry.py open` on
  Windows, `.venv/bin/python tools/cherry.py open` on Linux (`status` instead of
  `open` shows what the kit thinks).
* `.env` knobs: `CHERRY_AUTOSTART=ask|yes|no` (`no` also skips the download),
  `CHERRY_VERSION` (pinned; the store layout is checked against v2.0.x),
  `CHERRY_EXE=<path>` to use a Cherry Studio you already installed — the kit then
  only sends Cherry's official import link (`cherrystudio://providers/api-keys`),
  you confirm the popup and add the model id under the new provider.
* **Web search and tools are on by default.** The default assistant gets
  `web_search` + `web_fetch` as function tools (Cherry's stock keyless search
  provider, Exa MCP at `mcp.exa.ai`; change it under Settings → Web Search), runs
  MCP in *auto* mode, and the kit installs Cherry's keyless builtin MCP servers
  `@cherry/fetch` and `@cherry/sequentialthinking`. Tune with
  `CHERRY_WEB_SEARCH=1|0` and `CHERRY_MCP_SERVERS=` (also `@cherry/python`,
  `@cherry/browser`; empty = none) in `.env` — re-applied on the next start when you
  change them. New assistants you create in Cherry start with Cherry's own defaults
  (web search off) unless you copy the default one.
* Cherry Studio is [AGPL-3.0](https://github.com/CherryHQ/cherry-studio/blob/main/LICENSE)
  (see its README for the commercial-use terms); the kit downloads the official
  release binary and does not redistribute it.

## Prebuilt wheels: no compiler needed

Compiling the ExLlamaV3 CUDA kernels is the slowest and most fragile part of setup:
it wants the CUDA Toolkit and Visual Studio Build Tools, several GB of downloads that
have nothing to do with chatting to a model. Nobody has to do it, because the engine
publishes wheels itself.

Simplex looks for one in this order:

1. **`wheels/`** in the kit folder — what you copy off a USB stick.
2. **The engine's own release** — `turboderp-org/exllamav3` attaches a wheel per
   (CUDA line × torch version × Python). This is the normal path and needs no
   configuration.
3. **`WHEEL_INDEX`** in `.env` — one or more `pip --find-links` targets (a GitHub
   Releases page, a file share, an internal index).
4. **PyPI**, which has `triton-windows` but not `exllamav3`.
5. **Compiling from source**, for the cases none of the above covers — a CUDA line
   or platform the engine has no build for (aarch64/GB10), or no route to
   github.com.

Step 2 resolves to one exact URL rather than pointing pip at the release page, and
that distinction matters. The CUDA line and torch version live in the wheel's *local
version* (`1.4.4+cu128.torch2.10.0`), which pip does not match against anything:
given `--find-links` it filters on the Python and platform tags only, then takes the
highest version string. A torch 2.10 environment would be handed the torch 2.11
build, and the failure arrives later as an undefined-symbol `ImportError` that reads
like a corrupt install. So the launcher installs torch first, asks the venv what it
actually got, and names the one wheel that fits.

This is also why the default PyTorch index is **cu128**: the engine builds for cu128
and cu132 only, so torch from any other line means no wheel exists and everyone
compiles. cu128 covers Blackwell and needs driver 570+. (`TORCH_INDEX_URL` in `.env`
overrides it. aarch64 keeps cu130, since no engine wheel exists there on any line.)

A wheel is only used when its Python, ABI and platform tags match the interpreter it
is going into, so a `cp313` wheel can never land in a `cp312` environment. Check what
would be picked:

```
Windows:  .venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\wheels.py
Linux:    .venv/bin/python tools/wheels.py
```

That prints the venv's tags, the torch version and CUDA line found, and the wheel it
would install. `wheels/README.md` covers the override cases and the recipe for
building one yourself.

**Engine version.** This kit requires **ExLlamaV3 >= v1.4.4** (defaulting to **v1.5.0**) — v1.4.4+ is what the quantized
vision tower needs, and v1.5.0 delivers zero-copy pinned host memory arena mode and kernel optimizations. Engine:
[ExLlamaV3](https://github.com/turboderp-org/exllamav3).

## Installing on a Windows PC as an app

Unzip (or clone) anywhere, double-click `windows\START-HERE.bat`, then
`windows\start.bat` from then on. There is no system-wide install and no
administrator rights are needed; the first successful launch adds the Start-menu and
desktop shortcuts for you (`SHORTCUTS=no` in `.env` to skip that).

Whether the browser offers an **Install** button for the chat page depends on the
front end you use, not on this kit. Installing only ever works on `localhost` or over
HTTPS (a secure context); over a plain `http://` LAN address browsers refuse to
register a service worker, so there the page stays an ordinary one.

## Configuration

`.env` in the kit folder, created from `.env.example` on the first run of either
system. It is read as a `key=value` list, not executed, so values with spaces are
fine. The ones you are most likely to touch:

| key | default | what it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MODEL_DIR` | set by setup | which downloaded model to load |
| `CONTEXT_SIZE` | set by setup | tokens; must be a multiple of 256 |
| `CACHE_QUANT` | `4,3` | `4,3` (recommended 4-bit K / 3-bit V — saves 600 MiB), `4,2` (saves 856 MiB), `4` (symmetric int4), `8,4`, or `none` |
| `PARALLEL` | `2` | maximum concurrent / parallel requests generating on GPU simultaneously (additional requests queue in FIFO order) |
| `MAX_TOKENS` | `16384` | ceiling on one answer / maximum generation tokens per request (clamp-protected by available context headroom) |
| `REASONING_EFFORT` | `medium` | reasoning effort / thinking budget: `high` (unlimited), `medium`, `low`, or `off` |
| `NO_REASONING_PRESERVE` | `1` | `1` strips internal `<think>` blocks from prior assistant turns to prevent multi-turn context bloat (`0` to keep) |
| `GPU_MEM_GB` | set by setup | the process's VRAM budget |
| `VISION` | `auto` | `off` to skip the vision tower |
| `PORT` | `8888` | the OpenAI API port |
| `HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | set to `127.0.0.1` to keep `/v1` off your network |
| `UI` | `browser` | `browser`, `server`, or `no` |
| `SIMPLEX_HARNESS_PORT` | `3080` | the chat UI's port. Do **not** set `DSH_PORT` in `.env` — current dsh treats that key in a file as fatal and the harness never binds |
| `DRAFT` | `mtp` | `none` turns off speculative decoding |
| `SETUP` | `browser` | `console` for terminal questions on Windows |
| `TRAY` | `auto` | Windows notification-area icon; `no` to skip |
| `SHORTCUTS` | `auto` | Windows shortcuts; `no` to skip |
| `HF_TOKEN` | — | only needed for gated repos |

`.venv/`, `models/`, `logs/`, `apps/`, `.dsh/` and `.env` stay on your machine and
are not part of the git tree.

## Simplex, the UI this kit used to ship

Up to this version the kit served its own chat and agent UI in the server process.
That UI is now **Simplex**, a standalone project: nothing in it was specific to this
model or this server, and it talks to any OpenAI-compatible endpoint — including this
one, at `http://127.0.0.1:8888/v1`. Its conversations, projects and providers moved
with it, so an existing install picks up where it left off. Run its own launcher
beside this one and set `UI=no` here if you want it back in place of the harness, or
run both.
