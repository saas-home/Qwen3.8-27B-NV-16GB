"""DeepSeek Harness (`dsh`) - this kit's chat and agent front end.

The kit serves the model; the harness is what you talk to. `dsh` is DeepSeek's
open-source agent harness (MIT, https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness),
a Node application published to npm, so nothing of it is vendored here: the
launcher runs it with `npx` and it caches itself after the first run.

What this module owns is the join between the two:

  describe_model()  asks the running server what it is - id, context window,
                    modalities, and which reasoning levels its chat template
                    actually acts on - over the same /v1 any client would use.
  write_settings()  turns that answer into `.dsh/settings.yaml`, the document
                    dsh reads for provider routes, so the model is configured
                    before the browser opens and nobody has to type a base URL
                    into a form.
  start()           runs `npx @deepseek-ai/dsh@<version> web`, with DSH_HOME
                    pointed inside this folder so a harness installed here
                    cannot disturb one you already use elsewhere.
  watch_output()    reads back the one line dsh prints, because that line is
                    the only way in. dsh authenticates the browser with a token
                    minted fresh every launch: it prints
                    `dsh web: http://127.0.0.1:3080/?token=...`, and opening
                    that once sets a cookie good for thirty days and redirects
                    to a clean `/`. Open the address without the token and dsh
                    answers "authentication required; reopen the URL printed by
                    dsh web" - which is what happens to anyone who composes the
                    URL from the port instead of reading it.

The launcher owns two keys in that file - the provider route and the default
model - and nothing else in it. A copy of what it last wrote is kept beside it,
and generation stops as soon as those keys stop matching it: a hand-tuned route
survives every restart, and deleting the file is the only way back to a
generated one. Every other key is read past and written back untouched, which
is what lets dsh keep state of its own in the same document - it saves the
notices it has shown you there - without that freezing the join.
