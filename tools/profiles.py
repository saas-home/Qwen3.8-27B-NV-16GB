"""GPU-aware profile picker for the Qwen3.8-27B EXL3 kit.

Called by windows\\start.bat (via win_start.py) and linux/start.sh before anything is
downloaded. It reads the GPU's VRAM with nvidia-smi, works out which quant /
context / KV-cache combinations fit under the card's budget, shows two or three
choices (best quality vs. longest context) and writes the choice into .env:

    PROFILE, MODEL_DIR, HF_TARGET_REPO, HF_REVISION, MODEL_ID,
    CONTEXT_SIZE, CACHE_QUANT, GPU_MEM_GB, VISION

Runs when .env has no PROFILE line (fresh install) or PROFILE=ask, or when the
launcher is started with `profile` / `--profile`. Later starts keep the choice.
No third-party dependencies (system Python is enough).

    python tools/profiles.py                # interactive (what the launchers do)
    python tools/profiles.py --vram 24      # pretend a 24 GB card
    python tools/profiles.py --list --vram 16
    python tools/profiles.py --auto         # take the recommended option, no prompt

Memory model (all GiB; see the README's profile table for the measurements):
    need = weights(bpw) + kv_per_token(cache) * context * 17/16   (MTP draft cache = 1/16)
         + vision tower (0.87 measured; 0.17 for the 3-bit SC quant)    if VISION=auto
         + 2.6 overhead (CUDA workspace, GDN state, allocator reserve)
    must be <= GPU_MEM_GB - 0.4 safety,  GPU_MEM_GB = total VRAM - max(1.3 GiB, 8 %)

Where the context was grown until a real prefill failed under
a stated budget, the row carries that ceiling (verified_ctx / verified_ctx_vision /
verified_budget) and a card that size is offered the measurement instead - see
max_ctx().

#               (measured at load), not from shard sizes.
#               A row with measured=False is shown in the menu marked as an estimate.
# verified_ctx: the largest context that survived a real full-context prefill on the
#               bench card, images off. It is a known-good floor, not a hard ceiling of
#               the quant - a rerun on an idle GPU can raise it. None = never verified,
#               so only the formula below decides.
# verified_ctx_vision: the same measurement with the vision tower loaded, which is the
#               smaller number (the tower costs ~0.8 GiB at peak). None = never measured
#               separately, and then verified_ctx answers for both - the rows measured
#               before the two were split were run with images on, so their
#               single figure is already the conservative one.
# verified_budget: the VRAM budget those ceilings were measured under. It is what turns
#               a measurement into a plan: on a budget at least this large the context is
#               a fact about the card rather than a cap borrowed from a bigger one, so
#               max_ctx() offers it instead of the formula's more cautious answer.
#               None = the number is only ever used to lower the formula.
# verified_peak_gib: the highest VRAM the bench actually saw at those ceilings. It is
#               what the row costs when the plan is the measurement, because the flat
#               2.6 GiB overhead is a bound over every quant and at a measured ceiling
#               it prices the row above the budget it was measured under.
# never_exceeded: no run at any budget has ever prefilled more than verified_ctx for
#               this quant, so it caps the plan on every card, not just at the budget
#               it was measured under. True for 5.0 and 6.0: the 29.3 GiB bench found
#               nothing above 183296 for 5.0 and nothing at all for 6.0 (contended,
#               with ~40 other PIDs on the card), and the clean 22.1 GiB run reached
#               204800 / 83712. Rows without it have been measured past their figure
#               on a roomier card, so above their budget the formula plans.
